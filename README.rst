Project Euler: Haskell and Python
==================================

The following is a slowly-growing list of solutions to problems in `Project Euler <http://projecteuler.net>`_. Each solution is implemented in Python and 
in Haskell.

You can test that the Python and Haskell versions are the same using the ``test.sh`` shell script::

    $>./test.sh one
    Haskell solution:
    555
    Python solution:
    555

NB: Haskell solutions are not guaranteed to be optimum...I'm still learning the language.
